'''
Similar to lesson3, exercise4 write a function that normalizes a MAC address to the following format:

01:23:45:67:89:AB

This function should handle the lower-case to upper-case conversion.

It should also handle converting from '0000.aaaa.bbbb' and from '00-00-aa-aa-bb-bb' formats.

The function should have one parameter, the mac_address. It should return the normalized MAC address

Single digit bytes should be zero-padded to two digits. In other words, this:

a:b:c:d:e:f

should be converted to:

0A:0B:0C:0D:0E:0F

Write several test cases for your function and verify it is working properly.
